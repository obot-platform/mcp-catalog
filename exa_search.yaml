  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets AI assistants like Claude use the Exa AI Search API for web searches. This setup allows AI models to get real-time web information in a safe and controlled way.

  ## Remote Exa MCP üåê

  Connect directly to Exa's hosted MCP server (instead of running it locally).

  ### Remote Exa MCP URL

  ```
  https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=your-exa-api-key
  ```

  Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

  ### Available Tools & Tool Selection

  The Exa MCP server includes the following tools, which can be enabled by adding the `--tools`:

  - **web_search_exa**: Performs real-time web searches with optimized results and content extraction.
  - **research_paper_search**: Specialized search focused on academic papers and research content.

  You can choose which tools to enable by adding the `--tools` parameter to your Claude Desktop configuration:

  #### Specify which tools to enable:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "exa": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "exa-mcp-server",
          "--tools=web_search_exa,research_paper_search,company_research,crawling,competitor_finder,linkedin_search,wikipedia_search_exa,github_search,deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check"
        ],
        "env": {
          "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  For enabling multiple tools, use a comma-separated list:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "exa": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "exa-mcp-server",
          "--tools=web_search_exa,research_paper_search,company_research,crawling,competitor_finder,linkedin_search,wikipedia_search_exa,github_search,deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check"
        ],
        "env": {
          "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  If you don't specify any tools, all tools enabled by default will be used.
