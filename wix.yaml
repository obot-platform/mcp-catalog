  - name: WixREADME
    description: |-
      **Directive:** `WixREADME` is the **MANDATORY FIRST STEP** for all Wix-related tasks. Its output (including relevant linked documents) provides foundational context for all other Wix tools. Adherence to this protocol is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**.

      **Operational Protocol (Strictly Sequential):**

      1.  **Execute `WixREADME`:**
          * **Action:** Invoke `WixREADME`.
          * **Constraint:** MUST complete successfully. NO other Wix tool before this.

      2.  **Process `WixREADME` Output (Link Identification & Relevance Assessment):**
          * **A. Identify Candidate Links:** Scan `WixREADME` output. Extract *only* URLs found within `<urls>{urls}</urls>` tags. Ignore all other URLs.
          * **B. Assess Relevance:** For EACH candidate URL from (A), assess its relevance to the **current user's specific prompt/task**.
          * **Outcome:** A list of *relevant* document URLs. If no links are found in `<urls>` tags or none are deemed relevant, note this and proceed to Step 4.

      3.  **Fetch Relevant Documents (via `ReadFullDocsArticle`):**
          * **Condition:** ONLY if Step 2B identified one or more *relevant* URLs.
          * **Action:** For EACH *relevant* URL, invoke `ReadFullDocsArticle` to fetch its full content.
          * **Constraint:** All *relevant* documents MUST be fetched before Step 4.

      4.  **Proceed with Other Wix Tools:**
          * **Condition:** ONLY after completing Steps 1, 2, and 3 (if Step 3 was applicable).
          * **Action:** Use other Wix tools as needed, utilizing the full context from `WixREADME` and fetched relevant documents.

      **Summary of Critical Rules:**
      * `WixREADME` is **ALWAYS FIRST**.
      * Analyze `WixREADME` output: Extract links *only* from `<urls>{urls}</urls>` tags.
      * Assess relevance of *each* extracted link against the user's current task.
      * Fetch **ONLY RELEVANT** linked documents using `ReadFullDocsArticle` before any other Wix tool.
      * **FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE WILL LEAD TO ERRORS.** Strict adherence is mandatory.
