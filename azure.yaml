  ## Data Collection

  The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement). You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

  ### Telemetry Configuration

  Telemetry collection is on by default.

  To opt out, set the configuration option `AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY` to `false`.

  ## 📝 Troubleshooting

  See [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#128-tool-limit-issue) for help with common issues and logging.

  ### 🔑 Authentication

  <details>
  <summary>Authentication options including DefaultAzureCredential flow, RBAC permissions, troubleshooting, and production credentials</summary>

  The Azure MCP Server uses the Azure Identity library for .NET to authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID. For detailed information, see [Authentication Fundamentals](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md#authentication-fundamentals).

  If you're running into any issues with authentication, visit our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#authentication).

  For enterprise authentication scenarios, including network restrictions, security policies, and protected resources, see [Authentication Scenarios in Enterprise Environments](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md#authentication-scenarios-in-enterprise-environments).
  </details>

  ## 🛡️ Security Note

  Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

  MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.
