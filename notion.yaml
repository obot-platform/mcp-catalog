  # Notion MCP Server

  > [!NOTE] 
  > 
  > Weâ€™ve introduced **Notion MCP**, a remote MCP server with the following improvements:
  > - Easy installation via standard OAuth. No need to fiddle with JSON or API token anymore.
  > - Powerful tools tailored to AI agents. These tools are designed with optimized token consumption in mind.
  > 
  > Learn more and try it out [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp)

  This project implements an [MCP server](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro).

  ### Installation

  #### 1. Setting up Integration in Notion:
  Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new **internal** integration or select an existing one.

  ![Creating a Notion Integration token](docs/images/integrations-creation.png)

  While we limit the scope of Notion API's exposed (for example, you will not be able to delete databases via MCP), there is a non-zero risk to workspace data by exposing it to LLMs. Security-conscious users may want to further configure the Integration's _Capabilities_. 

  For example, you can create a read-only integration token by giving only "Read content" access from the "Configuration" tab:

  ![Notion Integration Token Capabilities showing Read content checked](docs/images/integrations-capabilities.png)

  #### 2. Connecting content to integration:
  Ensure relevant pages and databases are connected to your integration.

  To do this, visit the **Access** tab in your internal integration settings. Edit access and select the pages you'd like to use.

  Alternatively, you can grant page access individually. You'll need to visit the target page, and click on the 3 dots, and select "Connect to integration".

  #### 3. Click `Connect To Server` and Connect:

  **Note:** Make sure to set either the `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended) or the `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` environment variable (for advanced use cases) with your Notion integration token.

  ### Examples

  1. Using the following instruction
  ```
  Comment "Hello MCP" on page "Getting started"
  ```

  AI will correctly plan two API calls, `v1/search` and `v1/comments`, to achieve the task

  2. Similarly, the following instruction will result in a new page named "Notion MCP" added to parent page "Development"
  ```
  Add a page titled "Notion MCP" to page "Development"
  ```

  3. You may also reference content ID directly
  ```
  Get the content of page 1a6b35e6e67f802fa7e1d27686f017f2
  ```
