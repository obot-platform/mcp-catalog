description: |
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for generating images using Amazon Nova Canvas. Create images from text prompts with customizable dimensions, quality options, and color guidance for enhanced creative workflows.

  ## Features
  - **Text-based Image Generation**: Create images from prompts with customizable dimensions (320-4096px), quality options, and negative prompting
  - **Color-guided Generation**: Generate images with specific color palettes using up to 10 hex color values
  - **Multiple Image Support**: Generate 1-5 images in single request with adjustable parameters like cfg_scale (1.1-10.0)
  - **Workspace Integration**: Images saved to user-specified directories with automatic folder creation

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required AWS Credentials:**
  - **AWS Access Key ID**: Your AWS credential access key
  - **AWS Secret Access Key**: Your AWS credential access secret

  **Optional Configuration:**
  - **AWS Region**: AWS region to use (default: `us-east-1`)
  - **AWS Session Token**: Required only for temporary credentials like SSO or STS AssumeRole

  **Prerequisites:**
  - An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova Canvas enabled
  - IAM role/user with permissions to use Amazon Bedrock and Nova Canvas
