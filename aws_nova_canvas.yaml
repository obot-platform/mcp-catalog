  # Amazon Nova Canvas MCP Server

  MCP server for generating images using Amazon Nova Canvas

  ## Features

  ### Text-based image generation

  - Create images from text prompts with `generate_image`
  - Customizable dimensions (320-4096px), quality options, and negative prompting
  - Supports multiple image generation (1-5) in single request
  - Adjustable parameters like cfg_scale (1.1-10.0) and seeded generation

  ### Color-guided image generation

  - Generate images with specific color palettes using `generate_image_with_colors`
  - Define up to 10 hex color values to influence the image style and mood
  - Same customization options as text-based generation

  ### Workspace integration

  - Images saved to user-specified workspace directories with automatic folder creation

  ### AWS authentication

  - Uses AWS credentials for secure access to Amazon Nova Canvas services

  ## Prerequisites

  Set up AWS credentials with access to Amazon Bedrock and Nova Canvas
  - You need an AWS account with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova Canvas enabled
  - Configure AWS credentials with `aws configure` or environment variables
  - Ensure your IAM role/user has permissions to use Amazon Bedrock and Nova Canvas

  ## Configuration Options

  #### Required
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS credential access key
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS credential access secret

  #### Optional
  - `AWS_REGION`: AWS region to use (default: `us-east-1`)
  - `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: AWS Session Token (only required for temporary credentials like SSO or STS AssumeRole)

  ### AWS Authentication

  The MCP server uses AWS credentials to authenticate with Amazon Bedrock and Nova Canvas. Make sure the AWS credentials have permissions to access Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova Canvas. The MCP server creates a boto3 session using the specified credentials to authenticate with AWS services. Your AWS IAM credentials remain on your local machine and are strictly used for using the Amazon Bedrock model APIs.
