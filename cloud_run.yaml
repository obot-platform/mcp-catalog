name: Google Cloud Run
description: |
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to deploy applications to Google Cloud Run. Provides comprehensive deployment capabilities including file-based deployment, container image deployment, and service management with full monitoring and logging support.

  ## Features
  - **File-based Deployment**: Deploy applications by providing file contents directly to Cloud Run
  - **Container Image Deployment**: Deploy pre-built container images to Cloud Run services
  - **Service Management**: List, get details, and monitor Cloud Run services across projects and regions
  - **Project Management**: List available GCP projects and create new ones with billing integration
  - **Logging & Monitoring**: Access service logs and error messages for troubleshooting

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required:**
  - **Google Cloud Application Credentials**: Your Google Cloud Service Account Credentials.

  **Optional:**
  - **Google Cloud Region**: Default region for Cloud Run deployments (e.g., europe-west1, us-central1) default: europe-west1

  ## Important Notes:
  - **API Enablement**: The Cloud Run Admin API must be enabled in each GCP project where you plan to deploy services
  - **Deployment Time**: Cloud Run deployments typically take 1-3 minutes depending on container size and complexity
  - **First Deployment**: Initial deployments may take longer as they need to build and push container images
