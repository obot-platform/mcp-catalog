  # Elasticsearch MCP Server

  > [!CAUTION]
  >
  > **WARNING: this MCP server is EXPERIMENTAL.**

  Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store and vector database optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the foundation of Elastic's open Stack platform. Search in near real-time over massive datasets, perform vector searches, integrate with generative AI applications, and much more.

  Use cases enabled by Elasticsearch include:

  * https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]
  * https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/vector-search[Vector search]
  * Full-text search
  * Logs
  * Metrics
  * Application performance monitoring (APM)
  * Security logs

  \... and more!

  Connect to your Elasticsearch data directly from any MCP Client using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

  This server connects agents to your Elasticsearch data using the Model Context Protocol. It allows you to interact with your Elasticsearch indices through natural language conversations.

  ## Available Tools

  * `list_indices`: List all available Elasticsearch indices
  * `get_mappings`: Get field mappings for a specific Elasticsearch index
  * `search`: Perform an Elasticsearch search with the provided query DSL
  * `esql`: Perform an ES|QL query
  * `get_shards`: Get shard information for all or specific indices

  ## Prerequisites

  * An Elasticsearch instance
  * Elasticsearch authentication credentials (API key or username/password)

  **Supported Elasticsearch versions**

  Versions `8.x` and `9.x` are officially supported. Earlier versions may partially work, at your own risk and with no guarantees made.

  ## Required Environment Variables

  - `ES_URL`: Your Elasticsearch instance URL
  - `ES_API_KEY`: Your Elasticsearch API key
  - `ES_USERNAME`: Your Elasticsearch username
  - `ES_PASSWORD`: Your Elasticsearch password

  Either `ES_API_KEY` or `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` must be provided.

  If `ES_API_KEY` is provided, `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` are ignored.

  If `ES_API_KEY` is not provided, `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` must be provided.
