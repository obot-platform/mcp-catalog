  ## Overview
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a cloud-hosted gateway allowing AI assistants and developer environments to securely access Jira and Confluence Cloud data. Perform read and write operations such as searching issues, summarizing pages, or bulk-creating content via natural language commands.

  ## Features
  - **Jira Integration**: Search issues, create and update tickets, bulk process tasks from meeting notes
  - **Confluence Access**: Summarize pages, create documentation, navigate spaces and content
  - **Cross-Platform Actions**: Link Jira tickets to Confluence pages, integrate workflows across tools
  - **Natural Language Interface**: Execute commands using conversational AI without switching tools
  - **Secure Access**: OAuth 2.0 authentication with respect for existing user permissions and access controls
  - **Real-time Operations**: Stream contextual data and receive live responses from Atlassian Cloud

  ## What you'll need to connect
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - An Atlassian Cloud site with Jira and/or Confluence access
  - A modern browser to complete the OAuth authentication flow

  **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 flow will be triggered automatically when connecting - no manual API keys required.

  **Beta Access:** Currently in Beta with usage rate limits:
  - Standard plan: Moderate usage thresholds
  - Premium/Enterprise plans: Higher usage quotas (1,000 requests/hour plus per-user limits)

  > **Note:** This feature is currently in Beta. Core functionality is available, but some advanced features are still under development. The experience may vary across different clients.

  ### Data and security
  Security is a core focus of the Remote MCP Server:
  - All traffic is encrypted via HTTPS using TLS 1.2 or later.
  - OAuth 2.0 ensures secure authentication and access control.
  Data access respects Jira and Confluence user permissions.
