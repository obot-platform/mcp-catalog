  Give your client access to your Figma files with this [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server.

  ## Getting Started

  Create a Figma Personal Access Token with proper access to the data you would like to share with your agent.

  ## How it works

  1. Open your chat.
  2. Paste a link to a Figma file, frame, or group.
  3. Ask the agent to do something with the Figma fileâ€”e.g. implement the design.
  4. The agent will fetch the relevant metadata from Figma and use it to write your code.

  This MCP server is specifically designed for use with agents. Before responding with context from the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api), it simplifies and translates the response so only the most relevant layout and styling information is provided to the model.

  Reducing the amount of context provided to the model helps make the AI more accurate and the responses more relevant.
