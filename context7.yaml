  ## ‚ùå Without Context7

  LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

  - ‚ùå Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
  - ‚ùå Hallucinated APIs don't even exist
  - ‚ùå Generic answers for old package versions

  ## ‚úÖ With Context7

  Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source ‚Äî and places them directly into your prompt.

  Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

  ```txt
  Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
  ```

  ```txt
  Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
  ```

  Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context.

  - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write your prompt naturally
  - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
  - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get working code answers

  No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generations.

  ## üìö Adding Projects

  Check out our [project addition guide](./docs/adding-projects.md) to learn how to add (or update) your favorite libraries to Context7.

  ## üî® Available Tools

  Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

  - `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.

    - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

  - `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
    - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
    - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., "routing", "hooks")
    - `tokens` (optional, default 10000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than the default value of 10000 are automatically increased to 10000.

  ## üõü Tips

  ### Add a Rule
  > If you don‚Äôt want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your `.windsurfrules` file in Windsurf or from `Cursor Settings > Rules` section in Cursor (or the equivalent in your MCP client) to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question:
  > ```toml
  > [[calls]]
  > match = "when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation"
  > tool  = "context7"
  > ```
  > From then on you‚Äôll get Context7‚Äôs docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can add your use cases to the match part.

  ### Use Library Id
  > If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.
  > ```txt
  > implement basic authentication with supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for api and docs
  > ```
  > The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

toolPreview:
  - name: resolve-library-id
    description: Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a list of matching libraries. You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query. Selection Process - 1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for 2. Return the most relevant match based on name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized), description relevance to the query's intent, documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts), trust score (consider libraries with scores of 7-10 more authoritative). Response Format - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section, provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen, if multiple good matches exist acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one, if no good matches exist clearly state this and suggest query refinements. For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.
